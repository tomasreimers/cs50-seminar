                        When you type a URL, that URL gets turned into the address of a computer. Your computer then asks that computer for a specific file. The <b>web server</b> then looks up the file and returns the file to your computer.

                        For example, when you request example.com/foo.html your computer looks up example.com, it then connects to it and asks it for the file named foo.html. If you type in example.com/bar/foo.html, you computer would ask or foo.html inside of directory bar.

                        Files have permissions regarding who may read, write, and execute them (for files this means to run them as with ./my_file and with directories this means to open them). There are three types of people who may be accessing a file, the owner, the group that owns the file, or everyone else. 
                    </p>

                        If you interperate the numbers as binary (owner: 110, group: 000, and world: 000) you get owner: 6, group: 0, and world: 0; this is how you would set the permissions to that file as 600.To do that you would execute:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">chmod 600 my_file.html</pre>

                        If you do not specify a file to ask for, the web server will automatically return index.html (or index.php if present). So when you go to example.com, the actual file returned is example.com/index.html.

                    <p>
                        <b>Libraries (sometimes also called frameworks in this context)</b> are premade CSS/JS that you can use in your project. They speed up development time by allowing you to not write some common functions and instead focusing on the content specific to your site.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Typically including a library is as easy as including an external JS file:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
                    <p>
                        or CSS file:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-html">&lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; /&gt;</pre>

                        Using a Library
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Javascript libraries usually expose other functions you can call without having to write them yourself (similarly to cs50.h). CSS libraries typically provide classes you can add to tags to style them.

                    <p>
                        Libraries are typically open-source projects, meaning the developer chose to make the source code freely available. With that said some authors elect to reserve certain rights, and thus include a LICENSE.txt with their project describing their stipulations to the use of their project (typically things like attribution, or that your project must not use their name).

                        Because web browsers are given code from the remote server, and not an image, they still need to render the web page. However, not all browsers look the same even when you are using the same html/css. Normalize fixes this by 'resetting' their defaults to a common set.

                        jQuery is very powerful and has many different functions, here we will only cover a few of them. To learn about jQuery's full capabilities, cruise on over to <a href="http://api.jquery.com/" target="_blank">api.jquery.com</a>. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        DOM Element Selection
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The majority of jQuery's methods require you to select an element or set of elements. Selecting an element is done in a very similar fashion to CSS selectors.                         
                    </p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">$(".foo")</pre>
                    <p>
                        Will select all elements with class foo.
                    </p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">$("#bar")</pre>
                    <p>
                        Will select all elements with id bar.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        DOM Element Manipulation
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Once you have selected the element(s) you can do a wide range of things with them, including:                         
                    </p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">$(".foo").css("color", "red");</pre>
                    <p>
                        Alter its CSS.
                    </p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">$(".foo").html("Hello World!");</pre>
                    <p>
                        Alter its content.
                    </p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">$(".foo").remove();</pre>
                    <p>
                        Delete it.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        DOM Element Animation
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        JQuery provides a wide range of animation capacities, both for transitions:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">$(".foo").fadeOut();</pre>
                    <p>
                        or for aesthetic reasons:
                    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
$(".foo").animate({
    "width": "80px"
});
</pre>
                    <h4>
                        DOM Element Event Handling
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Another cool thing that you can do with jQuery is listen for events:
                    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
$(".foo").on("click", function (){
    alert("Hi!");
});
</pre>
<p>
    Generally speaking,
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
$(".foo").on("EVENT", function (){
    // YOUR CODE HERE
});
</pre>

                    <p>
                        Bootstrap is both a CSS and a JS library. It gives a lot of classes to make pretty sites (without writing css), and it even includes normalize; it also has many JS functions to script interaction of common elements (Dropdown menus, tabs, etc.)

                        Using the CSS component of Bootstrap is typically as easy as adding a few classes. To make a button you literally add the class btn and btn-primary (<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons" target="_blank">getbootstrap.com</a>).

                        Realistically, the easiest way to do this is with Google. Simply decide what kind of component you are trying to factor out (do you want a Library which can give you icons? which makes dealing with times in JS easier? that provides powerful animation?) and search for a library (e.g. "javascript library for color manipulation").

                        Almost undoubtedly you will run into <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> at some point in your search for libraries, Github is one of the major code hosting websites. It uses a protocol called git for storing and uploading code; if you do not know what that is, don't worry about it - as you can also download a ZIP of the files in the bottom right of a project page (there is a button titled 'Download ZIP').

                        Eventually you are going to have an issue or question which you can't figure out. Like the rest of the course, always feel free to pop into discuss or talk to a TF, but when you're actually building sites those aren't typically options. Again, the advice here is to search the internet because a lot of developer resources exist already.

                        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> is a question and answer site that is very popular among programmers. It is popular both because you can ask questions, but also because of the wealth of knowledge it has already amassed (Google a programming question, it already probably has an answer and is the first result).

                        <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank">JSFiddle</a> allows users to post small snippets of HTML/CSS/JS to show demos. This is very popular on sites like StackOverflow where people need to post a very small proof of concept or the code that is causing their issue.
